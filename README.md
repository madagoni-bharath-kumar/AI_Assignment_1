# AI Assignment 1

This repository contains solutions to two classic AI search problems implemented using **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** and **DFS (Depth-First Search)**. All code follows the class structure and format.

## üêá Q1: Rabbit Leap Problem
- **Filename:** `rabbits_bfs_dfs.py`
- **Description:**  
  Three rabbits (E) on the left need to switch places with three rabbits (W) on the right, using a blank space to jump/move.  
  The problem is solved using BFS and DFS while avoiding repeated states.

## üåâ Q2: Bridge and Umbrella Problem
- **Filename:** `umbrella.py`
- **Description:**  
  Four people with different crossing times must cross a bridge at night with a single umbrella.  
  Only two can cross at a time, and someone must return with the umbrella.  
  The goal is to get everyone across in 60 minutes or less.

## ‚úÖ Features
- BFS and DFS implemented using class-based state representation
- `goalTest()`, `moveGen()`, `removeSeen()`, and `reconstructPath()` used as per classroom structure
- Output format matches expected print style
